## CircuitPython
This project was programmed primarily in CircuitPython, using Adafruit libraries.  
The code has been tested on the Adafruit Feather M4, but would likely work on other CircuitPython implementations.  
The code would also likely work with a larger NeoTrellis, but would need to be modified to support the additional buttons.
